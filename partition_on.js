/**
 * Write a function which partitions a list of items based on a given predicate.

After the partition function is run, the list should be of the form [ F, F, F, T, T, T ] 
where the Fs (resp. Ts) are items for which the predicate function returned false (resp. true).

NOTE: the partitioning should be stable; in other words: the ordering of the Fs (resp. Ts) 
should be preserved relative to each other.

For convenience and utility, the partition function should return the boundary index. I
n other words: the index of the first T value in items.
